Sky Track - Mobile Application

Project Overview

Sky Track is a mobile flight tracking and travel support application developed to provide users with quick and accurate access to flight information. The app is designed for travelers, business professionals, and aviation enthusiasts who want a simple and reliable way to search for flights, view schedules, and explore route details.

The application allows users to securely log in, search flights using airport codes, view detailed flight information, and visualize flight routes using interactive maps. Sky Track focuses on simplifying complex flight data into a clean and easy-to-use interface. It is developed using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Firebase Authentication, and external flight data APIs to deliver real-time and trustworthy information.
